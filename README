What is this
==============================================================================

General information

TiMidity++ is a software synthesizer. It can play MIDI files by converting them
into PCM waveform data; give it a MIDI data along with digital instrument data
files, then it synthesizes them in real-time, and plays. It can not only play
sounds, but also can save the generated waveforms into hard disks as various
audio file formats.

TiMidity++ is a free software, distributed under the terms of GNU general
public license.

The history

TiMidity++ is based on TiMidity 0.2i, written by Tuukka Toivonen*1, released on
1995. No new version of this original project is developed since then.
Development has been continued by Masanao Izumo et al. in the new project named
TiMidity++. ++ is to show the difference from original project.
